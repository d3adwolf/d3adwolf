### Hi, there 👋🏻 I'm **Dmitry**, mainly interested in system administration.

- 🎮 Currently, I am engaged in the creation and configuration of servers with a modified kernel for various games.
- 🚢 Now I am studying containerization, working with Docker, Kybernetes, and Istio.
- 💻 I am also very interested in Windows Server and Linux administration and continue to improve my knowledge.
- 🔧 In the recent past, I was often involved in setting up servers from scratch for web tasks and data storage.
- 📷 As well as a hobby, I like to do photography, post-processing, and I also do video editing.
- 💌 You may reach out to me via email, which you can find a nearby profile description.
